# Python-SAS-Spotify-Analysis

#An extended analysis made during our Software Packages class in 2024, using Python and SAS programming tools.
#By processing a comprehensive dataset, it explores key aspects such as all-time top-streamed tracks, artist revenues in 2023, data structures, and music-related statistics. The analysis investigates user #preferences based on song characteristics, generates reports for events like Spotify Wrapped, and produces visualizations to support insights. The project offers a clear overview of current musical trends and #demonstrates how data can support strategic decisions within the streaming industry.
